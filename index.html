              <p>I'm a Software Engineer who's passionate about creating useful and aesthetic applications. Currently a fourth year attending University of California, San Diego pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I'm a techie geek and a brogrammer.

                <h2>I am Brian, UCSD student & Software Engineer</h2>
                <p>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish. This Steve Jobs quote is a quote that I try my best to live by. It should always be in your best knowledge to stay hungry for learning as one can never learn too much. However as I continue to learn, I also try to be grounded and humble. There is no reason for me to feel like I have learned enough. With this type of attitude, I believe the journey to accomplish my goals will be more realistic.
                </p><p>
                As an aspiring software engineer, I want to be able to create products that will solve problems or be useful to the general population. The thought of large amounts of people wanting to use something I create is what drives me to become a better software engineer. I dream to become a part of a team so passionate about possibly creating the next Instagram or Facebook. At the end of the day, I want to be able to sit back and watch people willingly use my product because it is of interest to them.
                </p><p>
                Right now, I am using every opportunity I get to improve myself and get myself closer to my goal. I've attempted and succeeded at being employeed for the majority of my college career in my own field. I've spent the last two years working at a medical software startup called Reflexion Health. And as of right now, I am being employeed by Sony PlayStation. In both companies, I have held software engineering positions. At school, I have been a part of many software engineering teams, having built websites, an iPhone app, and an Android app. I am constantly trying to better myself to reach my end goal.</p>

The goal was to get the web application to be feature-parity with the old clinician application by the end of 2013, which was considered overreaching.

                            <li><span class="causale">I got an internship offer from Sony PlayStation towards the end of summer to work during the fall quarter of my fourth year. The task I was given was to build an API from scratch for an existing web application. The end user for the web application come from different Sony Computer Entertainment Studios and needed a more efficient way of getting only their data, instead of sifting through a web application filled with other studio's data. That was the main use case of the API I built.</span> </li>

                    <h2>Starting <strong>Off</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mrgBtm20">
                        Reflexion Health was a much different experience than most would have expected. As I was starting my 2nd year of college, I had not had any type of internship or jobs. I was still walking around with my high school achievements on my resume. I interviewed to be a tester for this start up and it was my first interview for a software company. I ended up getting the internship and was given the task to test the company's software application. At this point, the company was only about a year old and consisted of 5 employees. 
                
                    </p>
                     <h2>Growing <strong>Fast</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mrgBtm20">
                        Reflexion Health was small, but every employee had a huge passion for the product. They were backed and invested in by billionaires Gary and Mary West. The company was small when I first started, but it was growing at a very fast pace. As the company grew, I grew with it - an experience not many college students or first time interns get to witness. By the end of my first year with Reflexion Health, the team had already tripled. There was about 15 employees by the summer after my 2nd year of college. I had stopped being a tester and other testers were being hired. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Moving <strong>Up</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mrgBtm20">
                        By the summer after my 2nd year in college, I had already been given a new position - Entry Level Software Engineer. I had become one of the developers for this cutting edge medical software. As a startup, this team needed and wanted to move fast to get to the end goal as fast as possible - a product they can ship. However, since the team was so small, everyone held bigger responsibilities, including me. Therefore, I learned at a much faster pace because of this fast paced company. I started off fixing small bugs and accomplishing what we called low-hanging fruit tasks. Easier tasks are called low-hanging fruits because low-hanging fruits on a tree are easier to pick than the ones at the top of the tree. By the end of my internship at Reflexion Health, I had been nicknamed the sniper for removing bugs quickly and had been a large part in creating the minimum viable product for the clinician's web application and helping in the implementation of the team's new API.

                        Reflexion Health is a medical software company that is trying to help solve the problem with reinjury in physical therapy. In the present, patients are coming into the physical therapists' offices once or twice a week for physical therapy. They are given exercises to do at home, but few actually do these exercises. Therefore, at the end of a patient's physical therapy sessions, the physical therapist believes they should be healthy on the belief that the patient has done all their exercises. However, because most patients don't do their exercises, they end up reinjuring themselves. 
                        </p>
                    <p> 
                        Reinjury in physical therapy costs over 100 billion dollars in costs, and Reflexion Health is attempting to solve that problem. Reflexion Health is creating a software application where the patient uses the Microsoft Kinect camera at home and do exercises assigned to them by the clinician. The clinician can then track their exercises at home and have a better understanding of how close to healthy the patient really is. The product is able to track the patient's movements and give tips and warnings so the patient can perform the exercises with confidence. The clinician is able to watch videos of the patients performing the exercises and make the final judgement on how far along the patient really is without the patient going into the office.

                    <h2>The <strong>Transition</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mrgBtm20">
                        Reflexion Health was home for me for two years. I have grown to become friends with the people there and people who I have had many hallway talks and lunch chats with. When I got an offer to work at Sony PlayStation, I didn't think the choice to leave would be so hard. I learned so much and was treated as a valuable part of the team which directly helped me in landing a position at a company as prestigious as Sony PlayStation. I ended up choosing to move to PlayStation because of the potential learning opportunities there and ultimately because I wanted some variety on my resume. Although the new skills I have obtained working at Reflexion Health could fill up my whole resume, I did not just want a resume filled with work in one place. This was what pushed me to leave a very good situation behind.
                    </p>
                     <h2>Change of <strong>Scenery</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mrgBtm20">
                       My work at PlayStation was similar to the work I was producing at Reflexion Health. At Reflexion Health, I was assisting my mentor in developing the company's API. However, at PlayStation I was the only one aware of how to build APIs. I was given the task to build an API for an existing web application. Although I had a mentor as well at PlayStation, we did not peer program and were not working on the same project. In my time at PlayStation, I experienced how a full-time software engineer may work - on projects by themselves. At Reflexion Health, my mentor handled running the server, which is something I never became familiar with. The API for the existing web application at Sony PlayStation was built solely by me, allowing me to better understand how to get my project hosted on a server and running for people to use.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Corporate <strong>Life</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mrgBtm20">
                        Corporate life was definitely different than the startup culture. There are definitely pros and cons to both. Some positives about corporate life is that because the company has already been successful and established, it has the funds to experiment with new projects. However, I can also see that moving up in a corporate company is much harder to do. Most have held the same position for many years and there is very little movement up and down the corporate ladder.

                        Sony owns many studios that create many PlayStation only games. Because these studios are owned by Sony, they do want the studios to do well. Therefore, Sony needs to create applications that these studios can use to track and analyze data about their games. This is why they implemented a web application that tracks first-party game data that employees of Sony studios can access and analyze data about their games. However, the data on this website consists of data from games created by all 50+ studios owned by Sony. Because of this, most of the data for a specific employee of a specific studio is useless to them.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My problem that I had to solve was allowing the studio employees to grab only data that they need. This is why I was to create an API for this existing web application. An employee of a studio is able to grab data for games created by that studio or a specific game. This allows first-party games to be able to programatically grab and post user data on their websites or upcoming maintenances for players to see. Other use cases for this API includes studios grabbing only their data from the database of all first-party game data and creating their own web application for their employees.
